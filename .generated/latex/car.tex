class Car is subclass of GLOBAL

values
    -- defines speed along a road
    -- negative speed means driving in the opposite direction
    private velocity : real = 10; -- m/s

instance variables
    -- reference to the road the car is driving on
    private road_id : RoadID;

    -- the progress of the car along the road
    -- a real number between 0 and the length of the road
    private progress : real := 0; -- m

    -- direction denoted by either 1 or -1
    -- invariant should exist to make sure this holds
    -- question: I could also use a specific type,
    --           but that's not as convenient
    -- note: Discuss this in the report
    --       Removing the semantics of having a direction on the road
    --         - The current intersection1 and intersection2
    --       This would mean that the car wouldn't neet a direction either
    --       We just need to keep track of which intersection it came from
    private direction : int := 1;
    inv direction in set {-1, 1};

functions
